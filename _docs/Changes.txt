File Movements
---------------------------
1. Moved \Helpers\Database() into \Core\Database()
2. Removed \Helpers\page_eloq.md
3. Moved Core/Config.php to Core/. Renamed Config.php to config.php

7. Renamed Helpers/Arr.php to Helpers/Arrays.php
8. Removed Helpers/phpMailer. It is available from packagist.
9. Removed Helpers/Data.php. They are just OOPs wrapper around simple functions, which can be called directly. 
10. Added Helpers/Validator.php, Helpers/Utilities.php, Helpers/Watchlist.php
11. Removed errorlog.html from root. Created storage/logs. From Logger.php, dynamic files will be created with date in the name.

14. Renamed Helpers\Document to Helpers\File. Added more functions

Code changes
---------------------------
* included \Core\Initialize() in index.php and moved the config call into initialize. 
* In Helpers/Assets, resource() would return string, instead of echo. useful when preparing html dynamically.
* Removed Url:: getSegment(), lastSegment(), firstSegment(). These can be extracted from segments();  
*  \Helpers\Url::templatePath(), relativeTemplatePath() renamed to getTemplatePath(), getRelativeTemplatePath()


TODO
---------------------------
- replace string functions with multibyte ones
- remove phpmailer reference from Helpers/Logger.php
- type hinting for all function/method parameters
