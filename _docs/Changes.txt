Code changes
---------------------------
* included \Core\Initialize() in index.php and moved the config call into initialize. 
* In Helpers/Assets, resource() would return string, instead of echo. useful when preparing html dynamically.
* Removed Url:: getSegment(), lastSegment(), firstSegment(). These can be extracted from segments();  
*  \Helpers\Url::templatePath(), relativeTemplatePath() renamed to getTemplatePath(), getRelativeTemplatePath()
* In Core\Router.php, added sub folder level to autoDispatch(). This will check for one more folder beneath controllers.
	 Those controllers which can not go into modules but need a subfolder will be accessible with this fix.  
* In Core\Database.php, added sql method. This will automatically extract result of select, show, exec. 


TODO
---------------------------
- Array input for routes
- replace string functions with multibyte ones
- remove phpmailer reference from Helpers/Logger.php
- type hinting for all function/method parameters
